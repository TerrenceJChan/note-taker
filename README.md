## Installation
This is a Node.js app, so make sure you have Node installed on your computer! Clone the repository into a local directory with the code below:

```
git clone https://github.com/TerrenceJChan/note-taker.git
```

With the terminal in the note-taker directory, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies. Run `node server.js` to start the server. By default, the server runs on port 3001, so navigate to `localhost:3001` in your browser to use the app.  
  
The app is also published live on [Heroku](https://young-fjord-40430.herokuapp.com), and can be run without installing the app.
